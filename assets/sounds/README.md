# Sound Files for Coin Toss App

This directory should contain the following sound files (OPTIONAL):

## Optional Sound Files:
1. **coin-flip.mp3** - Sound played when the coin starts flipping
2. **coin-land.mp3** - Sound played when the coin lands

**Note:** The app works perfectly without sound files! If sounds are not found, the sound button will be disabled (grayed out).

## Where to Get Sounds:

### Free Sound Resources:
- **Freesound.org** - https://freesound.org/
- **Mixkit** - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
- **Zapsplat** - https://www.zapsplat.com/

### Recommended Search Terms:
- For flip: "coin flip", "coin spin", "metal spin", "swoosh"
- For land: "coin drop", "metal impact", "coin table", "ding"

## Instructions:
1. Download two sound files (MP3 format recommended)
2. Rename them to:
   - `coin-flip.mp3`
   - `coin-land.mp3`
3. Place them in this directory (`assets/sounds/`)

## Temporary Solution:
For testing, you can use any MP3 files and rename them. The app will work without sounds too - just toggle the sound button off (🔇).

## Tips:
- Keep sounds short (1-2 seconds)
- Ensure they're not too loud
- MP3 format works best for React Native
