The app is set up to play sounds, but you need to add real MP3 files!

STEP 1: GET FREE SOUND EFFECTS

STEP 2: PREPARE YOUR SOUNDS
----------------------------
You need TWO sound files:

1. COIN FLIP sound (when coin starts spinning)
   - Look for: whoosh, swoosh, spinning sounds
   - Duration: 1-2 seconds
   - Example searches: "coin flip", "metal spin", "whoosh"

2. COIN LAND sound (when coin hits surface)
   - Look for: clink, ding, impact sounds  
   - Duration: 0.5-1 second

   assets/sounds/coin-flip.mp3
   assets/sounds/coin-land.mp3

STEP 5: RESTART APP

- Clear cache: npx expo start -c
- The sounds should now play!
